# Dune Elo Dashboard

A generalized version of Elo to track results for the TTS Dune: Imperium community.

The dashboard is deployed on Heroku: https://dune-ratings.herokuapp.com/

The Elo calculations are performed using djcunningham0's [multielo](https://github.com/djcunningham0/multielo)
package. Follow that link to reach the GitHub page for the package, which includes
